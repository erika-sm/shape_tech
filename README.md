## Reflection

_What we enjoyed_

- Creating many different handlers and RESTful endpoints for data manipulation.
- Making one universal validation function to pass through all of our handlers
- Deep diving in conditionally rendering throughout the project and linking them all together from different components.
- Learning and applying many different CSS styling techniques.
- Tackling bugs and resolving issues.
- Discussing and sharing ideas from each individual and properly merging them into one project.

_Difficulties faced_

- Constructing the functionality of the cart component.
- Connecting and getting the proper responses from the back-end to the front-end.
- Styling to ensure both mobile and PC optimization on render.
- Maintaining a Global Styles from multiple developer teammates.

_Lessons learned_

- Incorporating useReducers to build the cart component would have made for cleaner code
- Learned to optimize our code to ensure easier accessibility across all developers
- Proper communication is necessary at every step, especially when modifying functionality.

## Next steps:

- Implement Oauth and allow users to sign in from Google
- Enable more data manipulation on stock and orders in our database
- Incorporate additional styling across our entire project
- Incorporate pagination into our Products page
